# TheMartianLaunchDate
Python code snippet attempting to determine possible launch dates which meet the clues offered in the book "The Martian"
Created as an exercise for the article on the science of "The Martion" for WRAL-TV. http://www.wral.com/15228560/

2020 is rejected due to the plausability of creating the necessary technology then.  2032 doesn't work because no launch opportunities exist in that year, so 2035 is the answer.
